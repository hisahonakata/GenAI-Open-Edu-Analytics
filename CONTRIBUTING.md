 Contributing to Gen AI Open Edu Analytics

We welcome contributions from all community members, and we are grateful for every form of contribution, from code to documentation and beyond. This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Gen AI Open Edu Analytics project. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before submitting an issue, please check if it has already been reported. If it is already reported, you may add additional comments or express your interest in resolving it. If you have a new issue, click the "New issue" button and provide a comprehensive description, including as much relevant information as possible.

### Submitting Changes

To submit a change:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch in your fork (the branch name should be descriptive).
3. Make your changes in your branch.
4. Send a pull request.

In your pull request, provide a description of the changes and reference any related issues. For example, "Fixes #15, #17".

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure that your code follows any existing coding conventions and all tests are passing.
- Include tests that cover the changes you've made, if applicable.
- Document new code based on the project's documentation standards.
- Write clear, concise commit messages that follow our commit message conventions.

### Commit Message Conventions

Commit messages should clearly describe what the commit does, not just what files were changed or how; they should answer the question: What does this commit do and why?

For example:
```
Fix typo in introduction to user guide

This patch fixes a typo in the introduction of the user guide. This typo was causing confusion for users trying to set up their first project.
```

### Code Review Process

Every submission requires approval from at least one core contributor. We aim to review all contributions within two weeks. Reviewers will provide feedback if changes are needed. Once approved, a core contributor will merge your changes into the project.
